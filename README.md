# generate-readme

This was a great practice tool in getting more comfortable working with the file system, as well as inquirer.

Overall it felt like it eased me into the backend mindset by working with a restricted set of tools to capture all neccessary data and dynamically generate a whole file based on user input rather than just a small section

I always like to include checks to perfect error catching so I utilized the validate method inside the inquirer package to prevent nothing from being typed in. I look forward to looking more into how that property could be utilized to have more detailed restrictions.
